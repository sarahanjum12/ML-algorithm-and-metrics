This repository contains two machine learning models -one based on logistic regression algorithm and other one is based on linear regression algorithm.The logistic regression model works on a diabetes dataset  and medical data and make predictions whether a person is diabetic or not. This model is trained for classification and the classification report is printed as well.It also evaluates the accuracy,precision,recallf1-score on both training and testing data and prints the value. It also reports the test set mean squared error. The Linear Regression Model works on a student scores dataset and predicts the scores based on hours studied. It plots two graphs Hours vs Scores(Training set) and Hours vs Scores (Testing set).It also evaluates the final test set accuracy and test set mean squared error and prints them.
